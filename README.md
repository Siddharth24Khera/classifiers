# classifiers-ell409

This project consists of the tasks of building up different kinds of classifiers on various example datasets. 

We have implemented following types of Classification schemes for each problem

1. Bayes Classifier (with different class conditional densities and estimation techniques) 
2. Naive Bayes Classifier
3. K-means Clustering
4. K-Nearest Neighbor Classifier
5. Principal component analysis (where ever applicable)
